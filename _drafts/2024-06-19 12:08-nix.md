Nix is a triumvirate of: a language, a package manager, and an operating system. There are many articles that brilliantly describe the principles of Nix so I wont go into them here and will instead discuss the practicality of what Nix offers. This will also apply to any other system that works in a similar manner that may arise in the future.
