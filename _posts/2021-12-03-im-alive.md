It took a while but with a lot of swearing at DNS servers and router configuration screens I finally have a Ghost blog back up. It is self hosted on a raspberry pi so we will need to see how long it stays up (my money is on less than a week)

> update: it lasted over a year!

This blog has a few purposes:

- Track what I have learned in my 10% time through work.
- Reinforce that learning by having to journal what, where, how and why.
- Be a log / gallery of my astro-photography.
- May also include archery and unicorns!
