## Collaborative Post
This post is written as a collaboration with my team as part of a demo

## Blogging
- Find a blog that you are comfortable with.
- It can be hard to write a blog.
- You need to think about your audience.
- Doesnt need to be for others, it can be a personal journal or log.
- It can be cathartic to write posts even if you dont publish them.

## Cats are great
Cats are great, especially black cats. Cats are chaotic evil! [REDACTED] loves cats when they leave him presents.
People who live with cats are very lucky, cats make you happy. There is some debate about whether cats are divas.
> [REDACTED] does not like cats!
